### Web Infrastructure Design - Scale Up

### Infrastructure Overview:

This project focuses on scaling up a web infrastructure by introducing key components - a load balancer (HAproxy) and a clustered configuration for enhanced performance and reliability.

#### Components:

1. **Server:**

   - One physical or virtual machine serving as the foundation for the infrastructure.

2. **Load Balancer (HAproxy):**

   - Configured as a cluster with redundancy and load distribution capabilities.

3. **Web Server:**

   - Dedicated server handling HTTP requests, serving static content, and interacting with users' browsers.

4. **Application Server:**

   - Dedicated server executing server-side code, processing dynamic requests, and interacting with the database.

5. **Database:**
   - Dedicated server responsible for storing and managing data.

### Specifics About the Infrastructure:

#### Reasons for Additional Elements:

- **Load Balancer:**

  - **Why:** Introduces load balancing for even distribution of incoming traffic among multiple servers.
  - **Benefits:** Improves performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.

- **Web Server and Application Server Split:**
  - **Why:** Separation of concerns. Web server handles HTTP requests and serves static content, while the application server executes dynamic server-side code.
  - **Benefits:** Enables scalability and flexibility in managing different components independently.

- **Project Directory:** 0x09-web_infrastructure_design
- **File:** 3-scale_up

### Instructions:

To deploy and test this infrastructure, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mederhoo-scrip/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd alx-system_engineering-devops/0x09-web_infrastructure_design
   ```

3. Open the `3-scale_up` file to access the infrastructure design.

4. Review the explanations for each component, their roles, and the benefits they bring to the web infrastructure.

5. Customize the configuration based on your specific requirements or use it as a reference for building a scalable web infrastructure.

### Notes:

- Ensure that the servers are properly configured with the necessary software and dependencies.
- Test the infrastructure thoroughly to verify its performance, redundancy, and scalability.
